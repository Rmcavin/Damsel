# Damsel
A HTML5 Canvas RGP about a princess who saves her kingdom.

## About
This game began as my first project while in school for Web Development. I have always loved RPG games and wanted to use my skills in web development to learn how they work. I plan to continue adding to it until it is a full featured game. Contributions and feedback are appreciated!

## Code
The game uses HTML5 canvas with vanilla Javascript and CSS. HTML Canvas is a built in element for rendering graphics that can be manipulated via Javascript. The game engine is built from scratch in Javascript.
